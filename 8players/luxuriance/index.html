        Eight players compete on a large-sized 192x192 map. The teams consist of
        the four northeast players versus the four southwest players. Each
        player has their own base on high ground and access to a natural
        expansion on the low ground in front of their base. Third expansions
        ring the map on secluded high ground plateaus between each player's
        base. Fourth expansions dot the high-ground cliffs around the central
        ruins; these expansions are more exposed, but holding their high ground
        is advantageous. Fifth expansions are also available but are scattered
        throughout the central ruins and are highly exposed. Finally, additional
        mineral-only expansions occupy the four corners of the map; these
        expansions are the most secluded and are only accessible via air, but
        they are very small and do not offer any vespene gas. Controlling the
        central ruins is key, but these ruins are extensive, so coordinate with
        your team!
